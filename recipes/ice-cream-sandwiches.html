    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="pageul">
        <li>1 cup hazelnuts (4 ounces)</li>
        <li>1 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 large egg whites</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>4 ounces white chocolate, chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup Nutella</li>
        <li>6 sugar ice cream cones, crushed</li>
        <li>1 pint caramel ice cream, softened</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol class="pageol">
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375Â° and line a baking sheet with parchment. Spread the nuts in a pie plate and roast
            for 12 minutes, until the skins split. Transfer the nuts to a clean kitchen towel and let cool. Rub them
            together to remove the skins and transfer to a food processor. Add the confectioners' sugar and flour;
            process until the nuts are finely ground.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the egg whites with the salt at high speed until soft peaks
            form. Beat in the granulated sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the whites are stiff. Using a rubber
            spatula, fold in the ground nuts. Spread the batter on the parchment in a 9-by-12-inch rectangle. Bake for
            20 minutes, until golden. Prop the oven door open and let the dacquoise sit for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a microwave-safe bowl, melt the white chocolate in the microwave at high power in 1-minute
            intervals. Stir in the Nutella and crushed ice cream cones.</li>
        <li>Invert the dacquoise onto a surface and peel off the paper. Spread evenly with the Nutella filling. Cut the
            dacquoise in half to make two 9-by-6-inch rectangles. Freeze until the filling is set. Spread the ice cream
            over one half. Close the sandwich and freeze until firm, at least 4 hours. Slice and serve.</li>
